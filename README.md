# Imagine Base Template

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies with your preferred package manager (for example, `bun install`).
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and provide values for the required variables.
3. Start the development server, e.g. `bun dev`.
4. Build for production with `bun run build` when you're ready to deploy.

## Environment Variables

The template expects the following variables to be defined in your `.env` file:

```
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=
VITE_APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID=
```

Use `.env.example` as a reference when configuring your environment.
